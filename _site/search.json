Each observation in the dataset represents data on forcibly displaced populations, including refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people (IDPs), stateless people, others of concern to the UNHCR, and host community members. It includes details such as year, country of origin and asylum (names and codes), and counts for different categories of displaced individuals, from 2010 to 2022. This data comes from the UNHCR, UNRWA for Palestine refugees, and IDMC for internally displaced persons due to conflict or violence.\n\n\n\n\n\ndim(populations)\n\n[1] 126262     16\n\npopulations\n\n# A tibble: 126,262 × 16\n    year coo_name coo   coo_iso coa_name   coa   coa_iso refugees asylum_seekers\n   <dbl> <chr>    <chr> <chr>   <chr>      <chr> <chr>      <dbl>          <dbl>\n 1  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Australia  AUL   AUS       180000              0\n 2  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Austria    AUS   AUT       282000              0\n 3  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Belgium    BEL   BEL        55000              0\n 4  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Canada     CAN   CAN       168511              0\n 5  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Denmark    DEN   DNK         2000              0\n 6  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     France     FRA   FRA       290000              0\n 7  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     United Ki… GBR   GBR       208000              0\n 8  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Germany    GFR   DEU       265000              0\n 9  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     Greece     GRE   GRC        18000              0\n10  1951 Unknown  UKN   UNK     China, Ho… HKG   HKG        30000              0\n# ℹ 126,252 more rows\n# ℹ 7 more variables: returned_refugees <dbl>, idps <dbl>, returned_idps <dbl>,\n#   stateless <dbl>, ooc <dbl>, oip <dbl>, hst <dbl>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nclass\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nyear\ndouble\nThe year.\n\n\ncoo_name\ncharacter\nCountry of origin name.\n\n\ncoo\ncharacter\nCountry of origin UNHCR code.\n\n\ncoo_iso\ncharacter\nCountry of origin ISO code.\n\n\ncoa_name\ncharacter\nCountry of asylum name.\n\n\ncoa\ncharacter\nCountry of asylum UNHCR code.\n\n\ncoa_iso\ncharacter\nCountry of asylum ISO code.\n\n\nrefugees\ndouble\nThe number of refugees.\n\n\nasylum_seekers\ndouble\nThe number of asylum-seekers.\n\n\nreturned_refugees\ndouble\nThe number of returned refugees.\n\n\nidps\ndouble\nThe number of internally displaced persons.\n\n\nreturned_idps\ndouble\nThe number of returned internally displaced persons.\n\n\nstateless\ndouble\nThe number of stateless persons.\n\n\nooc\ndouble\nThe number of others of concern to UNHCR.\n\n\noip\ndouble\nThe number of other people in need of international protection.\n\n\nhst\ndouble\nThe number of host community members.\n\n\n\nWhy we chose this dataset:\nWe chose this set because we are interested in the consequences of real world policy.

The dataset is also quite clean, and has a good distribution of numeric and categorical variables making it ideal for analysis. We wanted to best connect what we learn in this class with real world applications, and this dataset seemed like the best fit.\nResearch Questions:\n\nHow does geography affect refugee populations in 2022?
