Where are refugees coming from and where are they going to?\n\n\n\n## Question 1 Graphics\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Graph 1\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 1\n\nTop 3 countries of origin \n  + Afghanistan\n  + Syria \n  + Ukraine \n  \n4th country almost thrice as small\n\nCorrelates with the events:\n\n- Taliban control Afghanistan\n\n- Syrian conflict\n\n- Russo-Ukranian war\n\n### Graph 2\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 2 \n\nTop 3 countries of Asylum are Turkey, Iran, and Germany\n  \nThe data have a more even spread.\n\nThree main types of countries of asylum:\n\n1. Near a country with some hardship (Turkey, Bangladesh, Poland)\n\n2. Near many countries with some hardship (Uganda)\n\n3. A good place to seek refuge (Germany, U.S.A.)\n\n\n:::\n\n\n## Question 2\nHow have refugee populations changed in Turkey over time?\n\n\n\n## Question 2 Graphics\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Graph 1\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 1\nThe general trend of refugees in Turkey is one of growth. \n\nThe rate of growth is faster than exponential. \n\nMost of the growth occurs right after 2010.\n\nThe rate of natural population growth should be a straight line on a log graph. This represents significant outside factors on the influx of Turkish refugees.\n\nInflux after 2010 is likely due to Syrian refugees. This is reflected in current data which shows over 3.3 million syrian refugees in Turkey as of 2023.\n\n\n### Graph 2\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 2\nRefugees makes up the bulk of refugee demographics throughout time.\n\nBig jump in Asylum Seekers and Returned Refugees during and after 2010.\n\nThe majority of rufugees in Turkey have historically been Refugees with Asylum Seekers also making up a large portion of the total starting in the 2000s. \n\nOthers of Concern to the UNHCR see a brief spike in the 2000s and 2010s. \n\n:::",
