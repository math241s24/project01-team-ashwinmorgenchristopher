We don’t care how many slides you use to do this.\n\n## Introduction {.smaller}\n\n* This data comes from the PopulationStatistics {refugees} R package.\n\n* The package is designed to give people access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Refugee Data Finder.\n\n* It provides an easy-to-use interface to the database, which covers forcibly displaced populations.This includes refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced people, stateless people, and others over a span of more than 70 years. \n  + The {refugees} package includes eight datasets. \n  + We will specifically be working with population data from 2010 to 2022. \n  + This dataset has 126262 observations and 16 variables. \n\n## Q1\nquestion + approach \n\n## Q1 Graphics \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: panel-tabset\n\n### Q1a\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Q1b\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Q1c\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 0 × 0\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Q1d\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Q2\nquestion + approach \n\n## Q2\ngraphs + discussion \n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::",
