Where are refugees coming from and where are they going to?\n\n## Question 1 Graphics\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Graph 1\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 1\n\nTop 3 countries of origin + Afghanistan + Syria + Ukraine\n\n4th country almost thrice as small\n\nCorrelates with the events:\n\n-   Taliban control Afghanistan\n\n-   Syrian conflict\n\n-   Russo-Ukranian war\n\n### Graph 2\n\n\n::: {.cell fig.asp='0.5'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 2\n\nTop 3 countries of Asylum are Turkey, Iran, and Germany\n\nThe data have a more even spread.\n\nThree main types of countries of asylum:\n\n1.  Near a country with some hardship (Turkey, Bangladesh, Poland)\n\n2.  Near many countries with some hardship (Uganda)\n\n3.  A good place to seek refuge (Germany, U.S.A.)\n:::\n\n## Question 2\n\nHow have refugee populations changed in Turkey over time?\n\n## Question 2 Graphics\n\n::: panel-tabset\n### Graph 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 1 {.smaller}\n*The general trend of refugees in Turkey is one of growth. \n\n*The rate of growth is faster than exponential. \n\n*Most of the growth occurs right after 2010.\n\n*The rate of natural population growth should be a straight line on a log graph. This represents significant outside factors on the influx of Turkish refugees.\n\n*Influx after 2010 is likely due to Syrian refugees. This is reflected in current data which shows over 3.3 million syrian refugees in Turkey as of 2023.\n\n### Graph 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](presentation_files/figure-revealjs/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Graph 2 {.smaller}\n*Refugees makes up the bulk of refugee demographics throughout time.\n\n*Big jump in Asylum Seekers and Returned Refugees during and after 2010.\n\n*The majority of rufugees in Turkey have historically been Refugees with Asylum Seekers also making up a large portion of the total starting in the 2000s. \n\n*Others of Concern to the UNHCR see a brief spike in the 2000s and 2010s. \n\n:::\n",
