The dataset also is quite clean and has a good distribution of numeric and categorical variables making it ideal for analysis.\n=======\nWe chose this dataset because we are interested in the consequences of real world policy. The dataset is also quite clean, and has a good distribution of numeric and categorical variables making it ideal for analysis.\nWe wanted to best connect what we learn in this class with real world applications, and this dataset seemed like the best fit.\n>>>>>>> 51028fee10025087861c8f5507bf42dbd60f2747\n\nResearch Questions:\n\n1.  *How does geography affect refugee populations in 2022? Where are refugees coming from and where are they going to?*\n    -   Variables involved: coo_name (Country of Origin Name), coa_name (Country of Asylum Name), refugees, asylum_seekers, idps, stateless (numeric variables indicating the number of people in each category)\n\n    -   Variables to be created: a combined variable, total_refugees_and_asylum_seekers, to represent the total number of refugees and asylum seekers from each country of origin to each country of asylum.\n2.  *How have refugee populations changed in North America over time?*\n    -   Variables involved: year, coa_name (focusing on countries in North America), refugees, asylum_seekers, returned_refuges, idps, stateless\n\n    -   Variables to be created: total_population_affected, combining refugees, asylum seekers, returned refugees, IDPs, and stateless persons for a comprehensive view over time. \n\n***\n",
